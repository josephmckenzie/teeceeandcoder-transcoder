You an do this stuff below but for now until I upload the whole tutorial I'm making it will not do you any good as you will need enviormental variables and I'm not giving them up. You will also 
1. Run "npm install" to install dependencies
2. Run "npm start" to start the web-server
3. Open http://localhost:8100 to see the website in your browser
